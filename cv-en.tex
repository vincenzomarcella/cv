Starting Finance is the point of reference for educational content about finance
for under 30s in Italy. It boasted, at the time, a community of over 400k
members across different platforms nation-wide. Together, we have created a 
mobile app that allows its users to gain exposure to financial products and 
simulate investments on the NYSE and NASDAQ markets with real-time data. The 
core of the app revolves around gamification, and social features, that allow 
the user to compete for prizes based on their wallet's yield, and to interact 
with one another through social features.
I have worked in the team since its inception, always overseeing the development
and engineering; treasuring, and participating in the team's growth by proposing,
and interviewing multiple candidates together with supporting pre-sales and 
marketing tasks. A lot of my work revolved around estimating workloads,
providing different implementation strategies, and cost estimates together with
developing and optimising algorithmic processes. Due to my relative seniority 
in this company, I have first hand experience on the whole product-lifecyclem 
and the bootstrapping of an efficient development team and an effective 
development process.\par
